 CKU_surrender_maine.0004.desc:0 "This “king” has refused our proposal. Eternal peace is now far away. It looks like war comes one step closer. Let it be known that the wise king never seeks out war but is always prepared for it. Weakness shall not be shown."
 CKU_surrender_maine.0004.a:0 "I deemed this king to be wise, he has shown to be otherwise."
 CKU_surrender_maine.0004.b:0 "He is a disgrace to any living being!"

 som_marriage_accepted:0 "According to the Treaty of Tours and the Marriage between Henry VI and Marguerite D’Anjou, the vile English king should have surrendered Maine when it was signed. Of course, being ever so treacherous, they have refused to do so until this moment. While my most hawkish advisors suggest marching an army into Maine, some advice caution and diplomacy."
 som_marriage_rejected:0 "Maine, a rightful French province, is brutally occupied by the villainous Englishmen and their weak King. It is our duty to the inhabitants to liberate them from these scums. While sending an army to crush them would serve them right, diplomacy may reduce the bloodshed."

 CKU_surrender_maine.0007.t:0 "A sharp demand"
 CKU_surrender_maine.0007.desc:0 "This ignorant king of France has outright demanded for Maine. This could be a bluff to make us back down but rejecting will nonetheless force us to go to war. Accepting would however make us lose face and show the world that I am weak-willed king, something that is not favourable."

 CKU_surrender_maine.0008.desc:0 "This French king has some wisdom after all. He has sent envoys that have proposed a deal. He offers to renounce his claims on all our lands except for Maine. In return he asks for Maine to be transferred back to the French crown."
 CKU_surrender_maine.0008.a:0 "A good attempt to deceive me, but a foolish one, nonetheless. It looks like war has come again…"
