We'll make sure to report back with any favorable trade deals." They wait for you to provide them with the necessary amount of gold so they can begin their journey."

We've acquired the [gunpowder|E] that has eluded us for some time! Our war engineers have already begun adapting this resource for use in a new weapon that they've called the Handgonne." They then retrieve a long pole like object and lead you outside to the courtyard. "With this we can change the course of history forever."\n\nYour Chancellor then lights the fuse at the end of the Handgonne and aims down range, firing off a loud bang that sends a lead projectile sailing through a suit of armor waiting at the end of the courtyard."
 CU_ARQ_main.0007.a:0 "We have acquired Gunpowder!"
 CU_ARQ_main.0007.a.flavor:0 "With the success of our project we have now acquired the means to procure gunpowder ourselves. Success!"
