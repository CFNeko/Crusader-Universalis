 CKU_On_Game_Start.1.d: "Welcome to Crusader Universalis, a mod that bridges CK3 with Eu4. This is still in early stages of development, but thanks to Crusader King's flavor mechanics, any player can have fun with the game. Currently, the most developed nations are: France, England, Scotland and technically Ireland which will be the focus on an update for the Hundred Years War.\n\nIf you have any feedback for us, tell us in our discord: https://discord.gg/DaaBgJM"
